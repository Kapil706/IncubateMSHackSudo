# IncubateMSHackSudo


IncubateIND

IncubateIND needs to build a Campus Ambassador Program for our representatives in colleges/ institutes across India so we can build the robots ecosystem.

    We should be able to assign tasks or goals to them
    Have discussions on active Hackathons/ events in groups or one on one
    Should be able to track the progress of the assign tasks

Note: Messaging, accounts, dashboards, rich media content support are some of the key requirements to be enabled on the platform.
IncubateIND is Indiaâ€™s leading platform to create Hackathons and tech innovation events to generate pathbreaking ideas for the industry.
